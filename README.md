## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
1. Repositories (Repos). These are folders where code files are stored.
2. Commit. This is used to register changes made to code in projects.
3. Push. It involves uploading local changes to github.
4. Pull. This downloads, or retrieves changes from github to our local machine.
5. Merge. Involves combining different branches and isused to manage the entire project.
6. Rebase. It involves merging that maintains a clean history.
Version control is essential in maintaining the integrity of a project since it tracks the historical changes made up to the most recent versions. It caters for changes that arise in software engineering projects that usually arise with time.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
1. Log into github.
2. Create new repo.
3. Configure the repo(name, and visibility).
4. Initialize
5. Push
One important decision that one has to make is to makethe repo either public or private.

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
The readme is very important as it gives an overview of what the code does. It also contains instructions and important information to naive users of the project such as logins. In collaboration, the README plays a crucial role in helping other developers understand the changes made easily thus enable them debug the project easily as well as pick up from where it is left.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Public repo is visible to everyone while private repo is only visible to the owner and invited collaborators.
Advantages of Public Repo:
1. Showcasing one's portfolio.
2. Open Collaboration
Disadvantages:
1. It is risky and prone to security issues.
2. One can steal another's intellectual property and patend it as their own.

Advantages of Private Repo:
1. Secure
2. Gives controlled acces
Disadvantages:
1. Contribution is limited
2. Portfolio is not available for hirers

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
It records changes made to files. Commits must have a commit message which is a description of changes made.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branching in Git allows developers to create separate lines of development within a repository. It enables multiple contributors to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main project. It’s an essential part of collaborative development on GitHub, enabling smooth teamwork and high-quality code releases.
Process of branching:
1. Create and switch to the new branch. git checkout -b feature-branch
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "Commit message goes here"
4. git push -u origin branch-name

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Pull requests" tab.
3. Click "New pull request".
4. Select feature-branch as the source and main as the target.
5. Add a title and description.
6. Click "Create pull request".

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forking a repository on GitHub creates a copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account. This allows you to freely modify the code without affecting the original repository.
Differences with cloning:
1. Forking creates a copy of a repository in your GitHub account while cloning creates copy of a repo in your local machine.
2. Forking remains linked, you can sync updates from the original repository while cloning requires that one adds a remote into github.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
1. Bug Tracking – Report, categorize, and track bugs with detailed descriptions.
2. Feature Requests – Propose and discuss new functionalities.
3. Task Assignment – Assign issues to team members to clarify responsibilities.
4. Tagging & Prioritization – Use labels (e.g., bug, enhancement, urgent) to classify issues.
How the above tools can enhance collaboration:
1. Organized Workflow – Tasks move through phases, eg. the development cycle.
2. Better Visibility – Everyone sees what’s being worked on, who is responsible, and progress status.
3. Integration with Issues & Pull Requests – Link issues directly to project cards for better tracking.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
1. Absence of git.
2. Signing up for github account.
3. Lack of enough support from mentors.
4. Authorization challenges.
